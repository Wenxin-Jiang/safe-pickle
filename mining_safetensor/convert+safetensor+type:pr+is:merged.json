WebUI now support sd-1.5-inpaint model but **not support sdxl-inpaint model.** The effect of **inpainting with sdxl-base model is not good**.  This PR is the **support for sdxl-inpaint model**. \r\n* The sdxl-inpaint model can be **downloaded** at [wangqyqq/sd_xl_base_1.0_inpainting_0.1.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/wangqyqq/sd_xl_base_1.0_inpainting_0.1.safetensors/blob/main/sd_xl_base_1.0_inpainting_0.1.safetensors). This model is originally released by diffusers at [diffusers/stable-diffusion-xl-1.0-inpainting-0.1](https://huggingface.co/diffusers/stable-diffusion-xl-1.0-inpainting-0.1) with diffusers format and is converted to .safetensors by [benjamin-paine](https://huggingface.co/benjamin-paine/sd-xl-alternative-bases).

With that, we could avoid having two conversions, i.e., phi-msft -> phi and phi (4.36.0) -> new_phi.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts!\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Adds support for using GQA/MQA with Phi-based models. This is a combined implementation between the old `PhiAttention` and `LlamaAttention`.\r\n- Fixes documentation official Phi-based models paths.\r\n- Adds support for dynamically pad the vocab_size to a multiple of 64 (better use of Ampere/Hopper-based GPUs).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nCongratulations!

Please also include relevant motivation and context. List any dependencies (if any) that are required for this change.\r\n\r\nOnce you're done, someone will review your PR shortly (see the section \"Who can review?\" below to tag some potential reviewers). They may suggest changes to make the code even better. If no one reviewed your PR after a week has passed, don't hesitate to post a new comment @-mentioning the same persons---sometimes notifications get lost.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Remove if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nI removed the conversion to RGB in src/diffusers/utils/loading_utils.py. I spent hours trying to figure out why my RGBA images were getting a black background upon loading. I then realized that this function internally converts images to RGB, which should not be the case because this function is only responsible for loading the image. It's up to the user to decide which mode they want to convert their images to after loading them.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Before submitting\r\n- [ ] This PR fixes a typo or improves the docs (you can dismiss the other checks if that's the case).\r\n- [ ] Did you read the [contributor guideline](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)?\r\n- [ ] Did you read our [philosophy doc](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/PHILOSOPHY.md) (important for complex PRs)?\r\n- [ ] Was this discussed/approved via a GitHub issue or the [forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/63)?

However, I am keeping the PR as a draft to reduce noise. In case there are some back-and-forth changes.",
